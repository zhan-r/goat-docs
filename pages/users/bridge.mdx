You can transfer assets through an exchange or a wallet to quickly receive them on GOAT Network.  
Currently, this feature only supports bridging BTC from the Bitcoin mainnet.  
If you already hold BTC in an exchange or wallet, you can use this method to bridge in BTC and obtain gas fees for GOAT Network.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Switch the menu to the “Receive” tab.**

2. **Connect your EVM wallet** or **enter a custom EVM address** to obtain your personal bridge-in address.

3. **Send the desired amount of BTC** to this bridge-in address.  
    ⚠️ **Important:** The receiving amount must exceed **0.0002 BTC** to avoid being treated as a dust transaction.

4. **From an exchange:**

   * Select BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet.

   * Use the provided BTC bridge-in address as the recipient address.

   * Note that exchanges may charge a withdrawal fee. Ensure the final receiving amount is not lower than the minimum limit.  

   * Some exchanges may take longer to process withdrawals. Check the withdrawal status in your exchange if you don’t see the transaction in your history after a while.

5. **From a wallet:**

   * Make sure the wallet supports the Bitcoin mainnet.

   * Confirm that the asset you are sending is BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet.

   * If the transaction remains unconfirmed, increase the transaction fee rate in your wallet.

6. **After the transfer is complete,** refresh the current page to update the transaction record or check the “History” section for this bridge-in transaction.

7. **Once the transaction is successful,** you will see the bridged assets in your EVM wallet.

## **Important Notes**

1. **How to obtain gas fees on GOAT Network?**  
   The native gas token of GOAT Network is BTC. Please bridge a small amount of BTC from the BTC mainnet to GOAT Network, such as 0.0005 BTC. Please note that **BTCB bridged from the BNB Chain cannot be used to pay gas fees** on GOAT Network.  
2. **The gas fee on GOAT Network is too high. How can I fix this issue?**  
   Please manually set the network fee in your wallet. It is recommended to set the **Max Base Fee** to \[**0.000130007**\], the **Priority Fee** to \[**0.00013**\], and check the option \[**Save these values as the default for GOAT Network**\] before saving the data.   
3. **How to switch assets?**  
   * Click on the network or asset in the Bridge panel to open the switching component.

4. **Wallet Usage:**

   * **OneKey**

     You can use both OneKey software and hardware wallets for transactions. Please note the BTC address types supported by OneKey wallets:

     * Software Wallet: **p2wpkh (Native Segwit)**, **p2tr (Taproot)**  
     * Hardware Wallet: **Pro**, **Classic1S**, **p2tr (Taproot)**  
     * For more details about OneKey wallets, please refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.onekey.so/connect-to-software/webapp-connect-onekey/btc/api-reference/signpsbt).

   * **Ledger**

     If you want to use this wallet, it is recommended to connect the BTC wallet to OKX and the EVM wallet to MetaMask.

   * **Keystone**

     If you want to use this wallet, it is recommended to connect the BTC wallet to Unisat and the EVM wallet to MetaMask.

5. **Fees:**

   * Cross-chain transfers may require the following fees:  
     * **Gas Fee**: Transaction fee on the source chain.  
     * **Bridge Fee**: For BTC, you only need to pay a service fee of 0.1% of the amount being bridged out and the gas fee for the first layer network. For DOGE and BTCB, every cross-chain operation requires a cross-chain service fee paid to **LayerZero**.  
   * Fees are dynamically adjusted based on the blockchain network status.  
       
6. **Transfer Amount Limit:**

   * Each asset has a minimum transfer amount limit. Ensure your transaction amount exceeds the minimum required.  
   * The BTC transfer amount cannot include more than 200 UTXOs and must be below the indicated value. Other assets have no maximum amount limit.  
       
7. **Supported Assets and Networks:**

   * The cross-chain bridge supports only the listed assets and blockchains. More networks and assets will be supported in the future.  
       
8. **Double-Check Addresses:**

   * Carefully check the target chain address when entering it. An incorrect address will result in **permanent loss of assets**.  
       
9. **Network Delays:**

   * If the transaction takes longer to process, please be patient. Do not resubmit the transaction to avoid the risk of asset loss.

## **Security Tips**

1. Always access the cross-chain bridge through official channels. Avoid clicking on unknown links or phishing websites.  
2. Always verify the contract address and bridge URL from the official GOAT Network documentation or announcements.  
3. Never disclose your seed phrase, private key, or wallet password.  
4. Ensure your wallet and devices are protected from malware.
